# commonTravelApp
an app where drivers add their rides and passengers can book a seat for theirselves.
It's my first app - a scheme for the project I want to do in the following weeks - a taxi booking app that uses Google Api 


The app was created in the InteliJ IDEA and Spring Framework.
I used:
-BootStrap
-Spring
-Spring Security
-Thymeleaf
-Spring Boot
-Hibernate
-MySQL
-Lombok
