# commonTravelApp

An application made on a Java BootCamp. People register as drivers and passangers. Drivers add their rides and passengers can book a seat for theirselves. 


The app was created in the IntelliJ IDEA and Spring Framework. For SQL operations I supported myself with MySQL Workbench

Technologies I used:
-BootStrap templates,  
-Spring JPA,  
-Spring Security,  
-Thymeleaf,  
-Spring Boot,  
-Hibernate,  
-MySQL,  
-Lombok,
